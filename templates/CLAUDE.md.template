## BMAD Swarm Methodology

This project is managed by BMAD Swarm, an autonomous development organization. The orchestrator agent coordinates all work through the methodology phases below.

### Autonomy Level: {{methodology.autonomy}}

{{#if methodology.autonomy_auto}}- The swarm operates fully autonomously. No human decision points are inserted into the task graph. The orchestrator makes all decisions and reports results at the end.
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.autonomy_guided}}- The swarm pauses at phase boundaries for human review. Key artifacts (PRD, architecture) require human approval before the team proceeds.
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.autonomy_collaborative}}- The swarm pauses at phase boundaries AND within phases for key choices. The human is involved in trade-off decisions and design alternatives.
{{/if}}

### Phases

{{#if methodology.phases.ideation.enabled}}- **Ideation**: Brainstorming, concept refinement, multi-perspective analysis
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.phases.exploration.enabled}}- **Exploration**: Research, discovery, feasibility analysis
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.phases.definition.enabled}}- **Definition**: Product brief, PRD, requirements
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.phases.design.enabled}}- **Design**: Architecture, technical decisions, UX design
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.phases.implementation.enabled}}- **Implementation**: Stories, development, code review, QA (up to {{methodology.phases.implementation.parallel_devs}} parallel developers)
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.phases.delivery.enabled}}- **Delivery**: Final validation, documentation, handoff
{{/if}}

### Quality Standards

{{#if methodology.quality.require_tests}}- All code must have tests. No exceptions.
{{/if}}{{#if methodology.quality.require_review}}- All code must pass adversarial review before merge.
{{/if}}- Human approval required for: {{methodology.quality.require_human_approval_list}}

## Agent Team

The following agents are available to the orchestrator:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **orchestrator** | Team lead. Assesses complexity, builds teams, creates task graphs, manages execution. Never implements directly. |
| **ideator** | Multi-perspective brainstorming. Refines vague ideas into actionable product briefs through four lenses. |
| **researcher** | Discovery, analysis, and context acquisition. Web research and codebase scanning. |
| **strategist** | Product strategy, requirements definition, PRD creation. |
| **architect** | Technical design, system architecture, technology selection. |
| **story-engineer** | Creates implementation-ready stories with comprehensive context and dev notes. |
| **developer** | Story implementation following TDD. Writes code and tests. |
| **reviewer** | Adversarial code review. Validates quality, security, and architecture compliance. |
| **qa** | Test strategy, automated test creation, coverage analysis. |

## Artifact Locations

All artifacts are stored in structured directories:

```
{{output.artifacts_dir}}/
  exploration/     # Research, feasibility, domain analysis
  planning/        # Product brief, PRD
  design/          # Architecture, UX, ADRs
  implementation/  # Stories, sprint status
  reviews/         # Code reviews, retrospectives
  context/         # Project context, decision log
```

Source code is in `{{output.code_dir}}/`.

## Key Rules

1. **Artifacts as integration** - Agents coordinate through files on disk, not message passing. Write artifacts to the correct directory. Read upstream artifacts before starting work.
2. **Stories are authoritative** - Developers implement exactly what the story file specifies. Do not deviate without orchestrator approval.
3. **Quality gates are mandatory** - Every artifact must meet its quality criteria before being marked complete. Self-validate before reporting done.
4. **Context is curated** - Each agent receives only the context relevant to their task. Do not read artifacts outside your scope unless directed by the orchestrator.
5. **The orchestrator decides** - The orchestrator determines team composition, task ordering, and process depth. Individual agents do not skip phases or spawn other agents.
6. **Halt on blockers** - If you cannot proceed, report the blocker to the orchestrator. Do not make assumptions or work around missing requirements.
7. **Never lie about status** - Report test failures, incomplete work, and quality issues honestly. The reviewer will catch dishonesty.

## Team Coordination Rules

These rules apply to ALL agents operating in a team, especially the orchestrator:

- **Messages are delivered automatically.** When a teammate finishes work and sends a message, it arrives in your conversation automatically. You never need to poll, check, or probe for updates.
- **Never poll teammates.** Do not use `sleep` + Glob/Grep/Read to check if a teammate produced files. Do not send "are you done?" messages. Do not re-read the task list to check status. All of this wastes tokens and provides no value.
- **Idle waiting is correct.** After assigning tasks and spawning teammates, the orchestrator's correct behavior is to either work on independent tasks or wait silently. Doing nothing between teammate messages is not a problem -- it is the expected state.
- **Send rich completion messages.** When you finish a task, send a detailed message to the orchestrator listing every file you created or modified and a brief summary of what each contains. This eliminates the need for anyone to verify your work.
- **Front-load coordination.** Create the entire task graph upfront. Assign all assignable tasks. Spawn all needed teammates. Then stop coordinating until results arrive. Do not create-watch-create-watch in a loop.
